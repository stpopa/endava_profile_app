# Endava Profile

This a open source, non-profit project, meant to unite Flutter developers in a coalition.

> **Coalition**: Organization whose members commit to an agreed-on purpose and shared decision making, to influence an external target, while each member organization maintains its own autonomy.



> All contributions to this project, will be reflected inside the app itself, in the credits screen.



## Contributions

To contribute you will have to:

1. `Fork` this repository
2. Pick a task from our [trello board](https://trello.com/b/hWb21RUx/endava-profile-app)
3. Consult our `zeplin` project for design
4. Implement the story
5. Make sure your git history coresponds to our `Git ruleset`
6. Create a pull-request from your forked repository to this one
7. Wait for our review and hope for the best



## Git ruleset

Our mission is to make git history an absolute proof of work, and your work will be credited inside the app itself, on a credits screen.

##### What do we mean by that?

1. In our `trello board` you will find in description estimation for each task. This estimation **should** correspond with the amount of **commits** your PR will contain. Otherwise your PR will undeniably be rejected.
2. Each commit should be descriptive, [`ticket title` - `subtask`(if present)].



## Thoughts on using /Forks/

- We do not want to force you some specific branching naming conventions. Take the repo, work with your preffered flow, Only the commits count.
- You will have to get more familiar with `git reset` , `git ammend` commands, and  `remotes`.  ^_^
- We do not have to mess with fancy github merge restrictions.

Have fun developing!
